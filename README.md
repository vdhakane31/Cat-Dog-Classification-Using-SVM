Cat vs Dog image classification using SVM with a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction.

# Cat vs Dog Classification Using SVM

This project is part of **Task 3** of my **Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal of this project is to classify **cat and dog images** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model and deploy it through an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

## 📌 Project Overview
Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision. In this project, I built an SVM-based classifier trained on a **Kaggle Cat vs Dog dataset** to accurately predict whether an uploaded image contains a cat or a dog.

The trained model is integrated into a **Streamlit app** that allows users to upload images and get real-time predictions along with confidence scores.
